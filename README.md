# Summary
Vermont vibe is the slogan used by my mom to portray her beautiful photography online. People are starting to use her art more and more, so we discussed centralizing her media onto a website where she can direct potential clients. With her rapidly growing influence, she needs a place to be able to quickly, efficiently, and safely show her art so she can distribute to clients with ease.

A website would solve this problem, as just forwarding images via social media can be messy, cluttered, and unpredictable. My goal with this project is to provide a solution to this problem. Further, this opportunity offers me a chance to deal with website security, image formatting & sizing, and to design and execute a website meant for consumer-oriented users.
